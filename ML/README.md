# Linear Regression – Medical Cost Prediction (Day-1)

## Objective
Predict medical insurance cost using personal attributes with Linear Regression.

## Dataset
Medical Cost Personal Dataset.

## Workflow
- Basic data exploration and visualization  
- Categorical feature encoding  
- Train–test split  
- Model training (Linear Regression)  
- Model evaluation using R² and Adjusted R²  
- Feature engineering with One-Hot Encoding  
- Interaction feature creation  
- Underfitting and overfitting analysis  

## Key Insights
Smoking status, BMI, and interaction features significantly impact insurance cost.  
Feature engineering improved model explainability and performance.

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
